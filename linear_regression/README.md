## About This Repository

This project is organized into three main parts:

1. **Concepts**  
   - Folder: `concepts`
   - Content: History, typical problems and potential issues, and fields of application.

2. **Code**
   - Folder: `code`
   - Content: Scikit-learn documentation and applied examples on the Boston Housing problem and study hours vs. performance prediction.
  
4. **Mathematics**  
   - Folder: `mathematics`  
   - Content: General representation of linear regression, the least squares method, equation based on a dataset.
