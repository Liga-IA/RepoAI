## History

**Linear regression** is a fundamental model in the field of machine learning, used to predict numerical values based on historical data.

In 1885, anthropologist Francis Galton, while studying the heights of parents and children, noticed that children of parents with below-average height tend to be taller than their parents, and children of parents with above-average height tend to be shorter than their parents. In other words, human heights tend to **regress** to the mean.

Similar methods, though not yet named regression, were studied by Isaac Newton in his work on equinoxes and by Carl Friedrich Gauss when studying the orbits of comets.
