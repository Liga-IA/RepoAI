## Fields of Use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the book Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, linear regression is used in many fields, such as engineering, physical and chemical sciences, economics, management, life and biological sciences, and social sciences. Regression analysis is extensively used in data mining and is a fundamental tool in data science.

### Regression model in a business example
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This example is about a paper that analyzed the effect variation of temperature has on iced product sales. They collected data on forecast temperature from one year prior and the sale of iced products and set up a mathematical regression analysis model using data mining theory with the treated data. They were able to learn how to adjust their production to avoid overproduction when sales are low and prevent a lack of stock when demand increased by the prediction that the model made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, with this model, a business would be more prepared to deal with the connection between temperature and sales of a specific product. In essence, this model provides the business with better planning and more accurate price labeling to manage their profits more effectively.


### Linear Regression on Astronomy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to The Astrophysical Journal, linear regression is one of the most frequently applied statistical procedures in observational astronomy. It is used to:

-	Quantify a correlation between two properties of a sample object, like the brightness of a star or the speed at which a galaxy is moving away from Earth, and its distance.

-	Compare astrophysical theories with data, thus validating or refining theories about how the universe works.

-	Perhaps the most important, quantify the "cosmic distance scale," which is essential for better understanding the shape, size, and evolution of the universe, or, in other words, its structure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, astronomers used a single linear regression method for all these purposes: ordinary least squares regression with two variables, which serves to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illustrating the power of regression methods in astronomy, a data set published in The Astrophysical Journal showed that the distance ratio between the Coma and Virgo clusters could be determined to within approximately 1% accuracy.
