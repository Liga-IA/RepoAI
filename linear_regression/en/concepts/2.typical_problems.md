## **Typical Problems Solved with Linear Regression:**

Linear regression is widely used to model and predict linear relationships between variables. Some common problems include:

### 1. **Forecasting Expenses Based on Income:**
    
    A classic application of linear regression is forecasting personal expenses based on income. Suppose historical data indicates that expenses are, on average, half of the income. By applying linear regression, future expenses can be estimated from known income values.
    
### 2. **Estimating Property Prices:**
    
    In the real estate market, linear regression can estimate the sale price of a house based on characteristics such as size (built area), number of rooms, and location. For example, a model might indicate that for each additional square meter, the price increases by R$ 2,000.00.
    
### 3. **Sales Analysis in Relation to Price:**
    
    Companies often use linear regression to understand how the price of a product affects its sales. By analyzing historical data on prices and sales volumes, it is possible to determine the sensitivity of sales to price changes.
    

### Practical Example

The Australian brushtail possum is a marsupial native to Australia. Researchers captured 104 specimens and performed body measurements before releasing them back into the wild. Among the measurements, two metrics were considered: the total length of the animal (from head to tail) and head length.

The scatter plot below shows the relationship between head length and total length of the possums, where each point represents an animal.

Although the relationship is not perfectly linear, a straight line can help partially explain the connection between these variables. For instance, it shows that possums with a total length above average tend to also have above-average head lengths.
