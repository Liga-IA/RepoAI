Logistic regression, as a statistical technique aimed at modeling binary dependent variables, was formalized in the 20th century. However, its mathematical roots trace back to the 19th century, with the studies of **Pierre François Verhulst (a Belgian mathematician and doctor in number theory from the University of Ghent)**, who was responsible for developing the logistic function to model population growth under conditions of limited resources. Although this work had biological purposes rather than statistical ones, the functional structure he introduced would later serve as a basis for the development of probabilistic models aimed at categorical data analysis.

However, the logistic function only began to be reinterpreted from a statistical perspective in the 1940s. The term "logit" was proposed by **Joseph Berkson** during this period as a logarithmic transformation of random reasoning, creating a simpler and more practical alternative to the probit model, which was widely used at the time. A significant breakthrough was achieved with the formulation of the logit, making statistical models more computationally accessible and more transparent in the interpretation of results.

The formalization of logistic regression is primarily attributed to **David Cox (a British statistician)**, who in 1958 structured the logistic model as a robust statistical approach to handle binary outcomes. It was Cox who proposed the use of the logit as a link function within the framework of generalized regressions, establishing the foundations of the model we know today. Later, **Edward John Snell** collaborated with Cox on works that addressed practical applications and technical aspects of modeling, although his contribution was more complementary than theoretical.

From the late 1960s and early 1970s, logistic regression began to establish itself as the preferred alternative to linear regression and discriminant analysis, especially in situations where the assumptions of these traditional models — such as normality and homoscedasticity (a condition where the variance of the errors in a regression model is constant across all levels of the independent variables) — were not met. This adoption was driven by the growing demand for more flexible methods and by advances in computational resources, which made routine use of estimation techniques like maximum likelihood possible.

During the 1980s, the spread of specialized statistical software such as SAS, SPSS, and BMDP further facilitated the use of logistic regression by applied researchers. In this context, the publication of **“Applied Logistic Regression” by David W. Hosmer Jr. and Stanley Lemeshow in 1989** played a central role by providing standardized protocols and clear examples of the model’s application across various fields, including medicine, epidemiology, social sciences, and education.

It is interesting to note that the growth of logistic regression was not driven by theoretical advances but rather by practical needs emerging across diverse scientific fields. Fundamentally, the method’s ability to handle different categories, accommodate many predictors simultaneously, and provide easily interpretable results were significant factors influencing its widespread adoption.
