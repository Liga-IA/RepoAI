# Assumptions and Limitations of Logistic Regression

## Assumptions
- **Independence of observations**: input data should not contain repeated or highly correlated values.
- **Linearity with the logit**: logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the log odds.
- **Absence of multicollinearity**: highly correlated independent variables among themselves impair the model.

## Limitations
- **Does not capture complex nonlinear relationships** between variables.
- **Requires adaptation for multiclass problems**, such as multinomial logistic regression.
- **Sensitive to outliers and irrelevant variables**, which can negatively affect performance.
- **Inferior performance compared to more complex models**, like neural networks and decision trees, on large datasets with complex patterns.
