The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model can be divided into two main categories: classification KNN and regression KNN.

## KNN Classifier

In classification KNN, the model assigns a categorical label to a new input based on the K nearest neighbors in the dataset. It checks the classes of these neighbors and selects the most frequent one through a majority vote mechanism.
## Example:

Based on the following dataset, let's analyze and understand how the KNN Classifier model works.

| Patient ID | Resting Heart Rate (bpm) | Cholesterol Level (mg/dL) | Diagnosis     |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| 001        | 82                        | 220                      | Heart Disease |
| 002        | 70                        | 190                      | No Disease    |
| 003        | 90                        | 210                      | Heart Disease |
| 004        | 72                        | 180                      | No Disease    |
| 005        | 85                        | 220                      | Heart Disease |

*Table 1 - Heart Diagnosis*

Let us consider a new patient whose clinical measurements include a resting heart rate of 78 bpm and a cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL. Our goal is to predict this patient's diagnosis by comparing these values to those in the existing training dataset. 

Defining K=3, the three nearest neighbors are:

- Patient 001 â†’ Heart Disease (distance: 20.4)
- Patient 002 â†’ No Disease (distance: 12.8)
- Patient 003 â†’ Heart Disease (distance: 15.6)

Next, we compute the votes and determine which label received the majority: 

Votes:

- Heart Disease: 2 votes
- No Disease: 1 vote

Thus, the classification of the new data point is 'Heart Disease'

## KNN Regression

In regression KNN, the model predicts a continuous numerical value. To do this, the algorithm identifies the K nearest neighbors and computes the average of their values to produce the prediction.

## Example: 

Based on the following dataset, let's analyze and understand how the KNN Regression model works.

| ID | Size (mÂ²) | Rooms | Price ($) |
|----|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 01 | 110       | 3      | 550,000     |
| 02 | 80        | 2      | 400,000     |
| 03 | 140       | 4      | 650,000     |
| 04 | 70        | 2      | 300,000     |
| 05 | 90        | 3      | 450,000     |

*Table 2 - House Price Prediction*

Let's consider a new house with 100 mÂ² and 3 bedrooms.

the three nearest neighbors are:

- House 01 -> 550 (distance: 10)
- House 02 -> 400 (distance: 20.02)
- House 05 -> 450 (distance: 10)

Thus, the predicted price will be the average of these three values.

$$
\text{predicted price} = \$466.666,67
$$
