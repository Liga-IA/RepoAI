# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Concepts, Mathematics, and Implementations

Welcome to this repository! Here, you will find an introduction to a widely covered topic in machine learning courses: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

## About This Repository

This project is organized into three main parts:

1.  **Concepts**
    -   Folder: `concepts`
    -   Content: History of the algorithm, its use for classification vs. regression, how to determine the value of K, typical problems, and areas of application.

2.  **Code**
    -   Folder: `code`
    -   Content: Code implementation details and a practical example in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).

3.  **Mathematics**
    -   Folder: `mathematics`
    -   Content: General ideas, distance metrics, the role of K in regression and classification, computational considerations, and the algorithm's limitations.
