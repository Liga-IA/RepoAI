## The least squares method

Let's say we want to determine the straight line equation of the linear regression model. It would be wise to think that we should have an equation that minimizes errors.
 
 The most common method for determining the best equation to represent the predictions is the least squares method, in which we minimize the sum of squared errors: $e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \dots + e_n^2$.

 > [!NOTE]
> As explained in [1.General_representation_of_linear_regression.md](./1.General_representation_of_linear_regression.md), the error $e_i$ represents the difference between the observed value $y_i$ and the predicted value $\hat{y}$: $e = y - \hat{y}_i$.

Therefore, more formally, the equation can be represented as:
$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

Here:
* $y_i$ represents the observed value of the dependent variable for each observation $i$;
* $\hat{y}_i$ represents the value estimated by the model;
* $S$ is the total sum of squared residuals, which we want to minimize;
* $N$ is the total number of observations.
 
 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Think about why we minimize the squared errors instead of simply minimizing the sum of the errors ($|e_1| + |e_2| + \dots + |e_n|$).

   One reason is that squaring the errors makes bigger ones count more, helping the model focus on fixing those larger errors and giving a better overall fit to the data
