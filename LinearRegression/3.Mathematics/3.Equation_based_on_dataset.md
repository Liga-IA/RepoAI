## How to find the simple linear regression equation based on a dataset
As previously explained in [1.General_representation_of_linear_regression.md](./1.General_representation_of_linear_regression.md), the simple linear regression can be represented by the equation of a straight line: 

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

The values β₁ and β₀ are unknown parameters, where β₁ represents the slope of the line and β₀ represents the y-intercept.

Therefore, to determine the values of β₁ and β₀, we must first collect all training data and organize it into pairs of coordinates (x, y). Ultimately, we will have a set of coordinates as represented below:

$$
\(x1, y1), (x2, y2),..., (xn, yn)
$$

Where n represents the total number of data points collected. 

As explained in [2.The_least_squares_method.md](./2.The_least_squares_method.md), we can calculate the values of $\hat{\beta_1}$ and $\hat{\beta_0}$ using the equations below:

$$
\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i – \bar{x} ) ( y_i – \bar{y} )}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} ( x_i - \bar{x} )^2}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{X}
$$

- $x_i$: x values of each coordinate
- $y_i$: y values of each coordinate
- x̄: simple arithmetic mean of the x values 
- ȳ: simple arithmetic mean of the y values

## Example

From one of the coding examples, let's analyze the relationship between hours studied and grades of a student.

| Hours Studied | Exam Score |
|--------------|------------|
| 1.5          | 50         |
| 3.0          | 55         |
| 4.5          | 65         |
| 6.0          | 70         |
| 7.5          | 80         |
| 9.0          | 85         |

Based on the data shown in the table above, we can calculate the values of β₁ and β₀ and define the equation of the line. For this purpose, we will define Hours Studied as x values and Exam Scores as y values. Thus, organizing all the data into pairs of coordinates, we will have the following points: (1.5, 50), (3.0, 55), (4.5, 65), (6.0, 70), (7.5, 80), (9.0, 85).

To facilitate the development of the β₁ calculation, we will compute the variables and the summations independently, as exemplified below:

- x̄ = (1.5 + 3.0 + 4.5 + 6.0 + 7.5 + 9.0)/6 = 5.25
- ȳ =(50 + 55 + 65 + 70 + 80 + 85)/6 = 67.5
  
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i – \bar{x} ) ( y_i – \bar{y} ) = (1.5 - 5.25)(50 - 67.5) + (3.0 - 5.25)(55 - 67.5) + (4.5 - 5.25)(65  67.5) + (6.0 - 5.25)(70 - 67.5) + (7.5 - 5.25)(80 - 67.5) + (9.0 - 5.25)(85 - 67.5) = 191.25
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} ( x - \bar{x} )^2 = (1.5 - 5.25)^2 + (3.0 - 5.25)^2 + (4.5 - 5.25)^2 + (6.0 - 5.25)^2 + (7.5 - 5.25)^2 + (9.0 - 5.25)^2 = 39.375
$$

By substituting the values into the original equation, we will arrive at:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{191.25}{39.375} = 4.85
$$

With the preceding steps completed, we are now able to calculate the value of β₀, as indicated below:

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = 67.5 - 4.85*5.25 = 42.03
$$

Upon substitution of the β₁ and β₀ values into the linear equation, the following expression is obtained:

$$
\hat{y} = 42.05 + 4.85 x
$$
